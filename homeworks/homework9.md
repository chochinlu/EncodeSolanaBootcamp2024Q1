#### Q 3:

Work through the PDA example : example6-pda


#### A:

Only `Read program accounts` is workable:

``` console
~/wsl_codes/solana_test/SolanaBootcamp(main âœ“) npm run call:6

> solana-course@0.0.1 call:6
> ts-node examples_baremetal/example6-pda/client/main.ts

Let's derive some accounts!

local system client config location:  /home/park/.config/solana/cli/config.yml

local system client config location:  /home/park/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
Connection to cluster established: http://localhost:8899 { 'feature-set': 4033350765, 'solana-core': '1.16.21' }
Pick option:
        Create PDA:     (1)
        Write PDA:      (2)
        Read PDA:       (3)
        Read program accounts:  (4)
