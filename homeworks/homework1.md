#### Q: 1. Tell about your goals for this course

A: Familiar with the priciples of blockchain, especially Solana, and proficient in Rust programming. Utilizing these two skills to create original projects, finding joy in the process, and earning reasonable rewards.

#### Q: 2. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server. Consider What are the essential pieces of functionality ? How could people cheat ? How could you prevent them from cheating ? This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any design.

A:

If it's a decentralized game like Monopoly:

- Players can participate from anywhere in the world.
- Transactions are secured using blockchain technology, ensuring immutability and transparency.
- Every transaction and game action is recorded on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify the game's integrity.
- Smart contracts handle game logic and enforce rules, ensuring fairness and preventing cheating.
- The development company doesn't require ongoing maintenance, significantly reducing maintenance costs.(maybe)

I believe key mechanisms include:

- Players' contributions needing a third-party to store and execute transactions.
- Random mechanisms, including dice rolling and card drawing.
- Data records, including user porfiles, transaction logs, game progress, and past game results.

Areas where players might cheat include:

- Modifying amounts.

- Showing expenditure but not actually spending any funds.
- Tampering with probabilities.
- Fabricating historical records, awards, etc.

How to prevent cheating:

- An escrow account where funds are held in trust while two or more parties complete a transaction.
  All logic execution, including dice rolling and data recording, is handled by smart contracts, ensuring that no one can tamper with them arbitrarily.

#### Q: 3. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?

A:

Perhaps CBDCs can indeed be seen as a step towards decentralization. While CBDCs still belong to the category of centralized controlled currencies, it's also possible for them to adopt blockchain technology for issuance.

This allows more people to understand the concept of blockchain and accelerates the development of blockchain and related cryptocurrency technologies, such as security, privacy protection, and scalability. Whether CBDCs will hinder or help the adoption of cryptocurrencies primarily depends on the policies and implementations of central banks.
